# DFW_Climate_Data_Visualization

This repository contains a Data Visualization Analysis I performed on a temperature dataset for the Dallas-Fort Worth Metro area from the yearas 1899 to 2022.

From it, the following visualizations were created using Python:

* Plot 1 - Multi-Faceted Bar Plot
* Plot 2 - Heatmap
* Plot 3 - Histogram
* Plot 4 - Boxplot
* Plot 5 - Proportion Plot - Pie Plot
* Plot 6 - Scatter Plot
* Plot 7 - Line Plot

Table of Contents:
1) Climate_Data_Visualization_Project.ipynb - IPython Notebook showcasing the Python code used to create the above listed visualizations along with the successfully run outputs.
2) DFW_Temperatures.csv - CSV file used to create the above listed visualizations. Feel free to download this if you seek to recreate this project or have an interest in performing your own analysis based on it.
