# DFW_Climate_Data_Visualization

This repository contains a set of data visualizations that I created based on a temperature dataset for the Dallas-Fort Worth Metro area from the yearas 1899 to 2022.

From it, the following visualizations were created using Python for the sake of exploratory data analysis:

* Plot 1 - Multi-Faceted Bar Plot
* Plot 2 - Heatmap
* Plot 3 - Histogram
* Plot 4 - Boxplot
* Plot 5 - Proportion Plot - Pie Plot
* Plot 6 - Scatter Plot
* Plot 7 - Line Plot

Each of the visualizations listed above along with a brief explanation of the insights derived from them can be found in the IPython Notebook called Climate_Data_Visualization_Project.ipynb

Table of Contents:
1) Climate_Data_Visualization_Project.ipynb - IPython Notebook showcasing the Python code used to create the visualizations listed above along with the successfully run outputs.
2) DFW_Temperatures.csv - CSV file used to create the visualizations listed above. Feel free to download this if you seek to recreate this project or have an interest in performing your own analysis based on it.
